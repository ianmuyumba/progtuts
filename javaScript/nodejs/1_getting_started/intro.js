    What is Node
      - Open source runtime environment for executing JavaScript Code outside
      of a browser
      - Quite often used to build backend services (API's - Web Apps & Mobile Apps)
          * Store Data
          * Send Emails
          * Push Notifications
      - Node is suitable for building highly scalable, data intensive & real time apps


    What's so special about Node?
      - Easy to get started and ideal for prototyping and agile development
      - Ideal for building superfast and highly scalable web and mobile apps
          * Uber, Netflix, PayPal have built their platforms on Node
      - JavaScript everywhere - Both for front end and back end
          * Codebases are thus cleaner and more consistent
      - Large ecosystem of open-source libraries


    Node Architecture
      - Every browser has a JavaScript engine that converts JavaScript code into
      machine language. The browser provides a runtime environment for JavaScript code
          * Microsoft Edge - Chakra
          * Mozilla Firefox - SpiderMonkey
          * Google Chrome - v8 engine
      - Node is a program that includes Chrome's v8 engine plus some additional
      capabilities that cannot be found in the browser
      - Node is not a programming language, neither is it a framework. It is a
      runtime environment


    How Node Works
      - Asynchronous/Non-blocking architecture: several requests can be executed
       without having to wait for one request to be accomplished
      - Single thread handles all requests
      - Not suitable for CPU intensive applications like video encoding or image
      processing. Node is however suitable for data intensive applications

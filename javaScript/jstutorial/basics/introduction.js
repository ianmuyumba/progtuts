	What is JavaScript?

		- Programming language that adds interactivity to your website
		- Makes a HTML document dynamic - can be witnessed when a button is pressed or when entering data into a form
		- CASE SENSITIVE - Treats cases separately

	Syntax
		Important Rules
			- Javascript is case sensitive (Food =/ food)
			- Use relevat casing with names
				* lowercase for variable names (myaccount)
				* camelCase for objects, classes and functions (myAccount)
				* UPPERCASE for constants (MYACCOUNT) - constants are values that should not change
			- Semicolons to end statements (var1 fruit = "apple";)
			- Javascript ignores white spaces

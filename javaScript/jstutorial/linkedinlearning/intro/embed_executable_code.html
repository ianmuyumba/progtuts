    <!-- 
        - The <script> tag is used to embed executable code (Javascript) into an HTML document
        - It includes the following global attributes
            * async - Evaluated as soon as it is available
            * defer - Evaluates after the document has been parsed but before firing DOMContentLoaded
                    - Scripts with the defer attribute will execute in the order in which they appear in the document
            * src - Specifies the URL of an existing external script
